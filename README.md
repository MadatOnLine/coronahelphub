In USA almost 20% of elderly people are in active work group and living pay check to pay check; while they are at high risk group but don't have option to stay home and be safe and considering this is such a severe problem; It's our responsibility as a citizen to help elderly or other vulnerable member of society by providing them physical and moral support. e.g. Help them ordering food. Help them ordering grocery, bring their grocery etc.

My idea is to build marketplace for elderly something like Task-Rabbit which shows if you have any volunteer nearby or just type your request. e.g. I am looking help to bring grocery and this message get broadcast to near by volunteer vice-versa. If someone going for grocery he/she just broadcast in website and notification has sent to rest of people looking for similar work. Looking someone help me to build front-end
